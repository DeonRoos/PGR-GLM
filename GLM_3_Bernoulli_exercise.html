<h1>Bernoulli GLM - Predicting if Netflix users will watch Lord of the
Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring</h1>
<p> </p>
<p>For the GLM exercises, we’ll use the workflow we suggested in the
first GLM overview lecture as a template, specifically:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>Know your research question!</p></li>
<li><p>Think about your response variable (stochastic).</p></li>
<li><p>Think about the process behind the data (deterministic).</p></li>
<li><p>Understand the data that you’ve collected (plot it!)</p></li>
<li><p>Combine into a model that can answer your question.</p></li>
<li><p>Fit the model.</p></li>
<li><p>Check your assumption(s).</p></li>
<li><p>Answer your question.</p></li>
</ol>
<p><br />
</p>
<div id="know-your-research-question" class="section level3">
<h3>1. Know your research question!</h3>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>For this final exercise, we’ll do something that’s, hopefully, a bit
fun and silly. We’re going to work with a relatively small Netflix
dataset, where we’re going to try and <em>predict</em> if a user will
will watch Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring. I will admit
to a number of ulterior motivations in ending the course using this
dataset.</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>There is a common misconception that Machine Learning is for
predicting and Statistics is for understanding. I want to show that this
distinction is meaningless. In truth, machine learning is, in general,
statistics performed (or in some cases developed) by computer
scientists. For example, the GLMs you’ve learned to use on this course
are often called Supervised Machine Learning Models in Machine Learning
courses. The distinction between the two methods largely comes down to
who is teaching you (and who taught them). Indeed, some “classic”
machine learning methods such as Random Forest models are just GLMs with
a few extra bells and whistles in much the same way that some “classic”
statistical methods such as Mixed Effects models are just GLMs with a
few extra bells and whistles.</p></li>
<li><p>Because people tend to think of there being some sort of
distinction between Machine Learning and Statistics, it can result in
people, such as yourselves, not realising they have skill-sets that lots
of employers (including non-academic) are looking for. By using this
Netflix example I want to show that, having taken this course, your
employment options have broadened.</p></li>
<li><p>In the final and corresponding <span
class="math inline">\(Bernoulli\)</span> GLM lecture, I showed an
example where AIC fails miserably. In doing so, I’m at risk of leaving
you with the impression that AIC (and also other forms of model and
variable selection) should never be used. Therefore, in this exercise
we’re going to use an example where AIC is wonderfully well suited for
helping achieve our objective. It will also give me an opportunity to
talk a little more about how AIC works, and also the controversy and
differing opinions on AIC.</p></li>
<li><p>I really like Lord of the Rings.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>While this exercise takes on an industry focus, this is not specific
to <span class="math inline">\(Bernoulli\)</span> GLMs. Indeed, like all
GLMs and LMs, <span class="math inline">\(Bernoulli\)</span> GLMs can be
used for any of the three broad purposes we described in the first
lecture: Causal inference, prediction or description.</p>
<p>The data you’ve been provided includes various information that
Netflix has on hand about their users, for the purposes of predicting if
a user will watch Lord of the Rings (LoTR). To do so, our response
variable if whether not a given viewer watched LoTR (1) or not (0).</p>
<p>The covariates we have are: * <code>user</code> - a unique user ID *
<code>lotr</code> - if that user watched LoTR on Netflix *
<code>premium</code> - if the user has Netflix Premium or Standard *
<code>age</code> - the age of the user at the time of data collection *
<code>genre_likes</code> - how many fantasy films/shows the user had
previously liked * <code>actor_likes</code> - how many films/shows the
user had previously liked that included cast members of LoTR *
<code>similar_user_ratins</code> - what lotr of “similar” users had
liked LoTR (“similar” is undefined) * <code>mean_time_genre</code> -
what is the average length of time users watch fantasy media *
<code>user_time</code> - Time of day for user at time of data collection
(<code>Morning</code>, <code>Afternoon</code> and <code>Evening</code>)
* <code>user_day</code> - Day of week for user at time of data
collection (<code>Monday</code>, <code>Tuesday</code>, etc.) *
<code>user_device</code> - Type of device user was logged in from
(<code>TV</code>, <code>PC</code>, <code>Mobile Device</code> and
<code>Gaming Device</code>) * <code>fam_members</code> - Number of
family member accounts tied to subscription * <code>country</code> -
Country of subscription</p>
<p>As concisely as possible, write down the research question that can
be answered with our analysis, keeping in mind that Netflix are not
interested in understanding causation or writing a scientific paper,
they want predictive power.</p>

<h3>2. Think about your response variable (the stochastic element).</h3>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>From the information provided in the description above, we can
determine that a <span class="math inline">\(Bernoulli\)</span>
distribution is a sensible one to use here; our data is 0 (user did not
watch LoTR) or 1 (user did watch LoTR). Our stochastic element of the
model would therefore be:</p>
<p><span class="math inline">\(y_i \sim Bernoulli(p_i)\)</span></p>
<p>Where <span class="math inline">\(y\)</span> is if user <span
class="math inline">\(i\)</span> watched LoTR or not, generated
according to a <span class="math inline">\(Bernoulli\)</span>
distribution, with probability <span
class="math inline">\(p\)</span>.</p>

<div
id="think-about-the-process-behind-the-data-the-deterministic-element."
class="section level3">
<h3>3. Think about the process behind the data (the deterministic
element).</h3>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Just like the drinking coffee example from the first lecture, the
<em>Data Generating Process</em> (DGP) for whether or not someone
watches a particular film on Netflix is going to be incredibly complex.
A nuance here is that our objective and intended use for this analysis
is prediction. When that’s the case, we can be a bit more relaxed about
understanding the deep complexity underlying the DGP and instead feel
relatively comfortable adding any and all covariates for which we have
data, with an important caveat. We must be confident that we are not
including any covariates which have no conceivable connection to our
response. For example, we wouldn’t want to include average sea surface
temperature because it shouldn’t give us any predictive power. But if
we’re unlucky, it may be correlated (by pure chance) with LoTR
viewership and thus we may think it helps us do predictions (see <a
href="https://www.tylervigen.com/spurious-correlations">this</a> website
for fun examples of such spurious correlations).</p>
<p>In this dataset, Netflix have collected covariates for the explicit
purpose of predicting viewership, so we can be confident that at least
<em>someone</em> thinks these variables might give us some predictive
power and aren’t spurious correlations.</p>
<p>With that said, our model will still have a deterministic equation
that describes the associations. Given how many variables we have it
would be cruel to task you with writing the equation out in full for a
model that contains all of those covariates. Instead, assume our model
was <code>lotr ~ age + user_time</code>. Use this simplified version of
the model to write out the equation that would underpin it. Note that
<code>age</code> is a continuous variable, and <code>user_time</code> is
a categorical variable with the levels <code>Morning</code>,
<code>Afternoon</code> and <code>Evening</code>.</p>
<p>For this equation, I’m not giving any hints so the difficulty does
spike here. If you’re struggling, ask for help. It really is worthwhile
learning how the syntax <code>lotr ~ age + user_time</code> is
translated into an equation, especially when you’re ready to go beyond
GLMs.</p>

<div id="understand-the-data-that-youve-collected-plot-it"
class="section level3">
<h3>4. Understand the data that you’ve collected (plot it!)</h3>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Import the data file ‘netflix.txt’ into R. Take a look at the
structure of the data and create plots that you feel will help you (and
others) understand the data.</p>
<p>Keep the tips and tricks you used in yesterday’s practical and feel
free to use them again here; load in the data, check for any covariates
you need to adjust, plot out the data, etc.</p>
<p>A bit of advice for visualising <span
class="math inline">\(Bernoulli\)</span> data; adding a little noise to
the x and y-axis values for each point (i.e. jittering) helps immensely
for visualising. To do so using <code>base</code> <code>R</code>, the
code would be:</p>
<pre><code>plot(jitter(my_data$y) ~ my_data$x)</code></pre>
<p>As in yesterday’s lecture and exercise, the my figures below are
produced using <code>ggplot2</code> and are included purely for
inspiration. I am also using an additional package,
<code>patchwork</code>, to stitch together multiple figures into a
single panel.</p>

<h3>5. Combine into a model that can answer your question.</h3>

</p>
<p>Having gone through the previous steps, it’s now time to run our
model. Keep in mind that with this model, our objective is prediction,
so we’ll be running a model that includes all available covariates
excluding one; <code>user_id</code> as including just this one covariate
will require <strong>15,000</strong> parameters be estimated. We don’t
want that, nor do we have the sample size to support it.</p>
<p>Run the full model (not including <code>user_id</code>), using
<code>glm()</code>.</p>

<div id="variable-selection" class="section level3">
<h3>6. Variable selection</h3>
<p>Given that in the lecture I showed an instance where AIC and variable
selection failed quite miserably, in this exercise, I wanted to include
a scenario where it performs very well.</p>
<p>Note that this discussion below is also true for Likelihood Ratio
Testing (LRT). In fact, AIC ends up being the equivalent to LRT, where
the P-value threshold to 0.187 rather than 0.05 (see Sutherland et al.,
<a href="https://doi.org/10.1098/rspb.2023.1261%5D">2023</a>).</p>
<p>For that, we need to have a brief discussion about how AIC works,
starting with how it is calculated:</p>
<p><span class="math inline">\(AIC = 2K -
2ln(\mathcal{\hat{L}})\)</span></p>
<p>where <span class="math inline">\(K\)</span> is the number of
parameters in our model, <span class="math inline">\(ln\)</span> is the
natural log, and <span class="math inline">\(\mathcal{\hat{L}}\)</span>
is the maximum likelihood value for our given model. (Note that in
practice <span class="math inline">\(-2ln(\mathcal{\hat{L}})\)</span> is
used in model fitting for reasons that are not important here).</p>
<p>Think back to the <span class="math inline">\(Poisson\)</span> GLM
lecture where we walked through how <span
class="math inline">\(\mathcal{\hat{L}}\)</span> was derived. In that
example, we were just trying different values for each parameter until
we hit the “sweet spot” - where our predicted values were closest to our
observed values using a particular combination of parameter values.
Basically, <span class="math inline">\(\mathcal{\hat{L}}\)</span> is a
value that reflects how well a combination of parameter values results
in predicted values that are as close as possible to our actual response
variable.</p>
<p>Where AIC comes in, is that it uses this <span
class="math inline">\(\mathcal{\hat{L}}\)</span> value and asks; “Are
all of these parameters needed to get to the best fit?” That’s why AIC
include the <span class="math inline">\(2K\)</span> bit. Each parameter
has a “cost” associated with it of <span class="math inline">\(+2
AIC\)</span> units; AIC is a fit-versus-cost trade-off. If the cost of
including a parameter in our model does not sufficiently improve our
likelihood, then it is considered to be uninformative, and AIC tells us
it’s not worth including in the model. The conventional threshold is
that if the difference when removing a variable from a model is less
than or equal to <span class="math inline">\(2 \Delta AIC\)</span>
(where <span class="math inline">\(\Delta\)</span> just means
difference), then the covariate can be removed.</p>
<p>Going through this process, we are left with the most parsimonious
model; the model that has a desired level of accuracy (or prediction)
that uses the fewest variables as possible to do so. This is why some
statisticians (myself included) tend to think of AIC as a “with-in
sample predictive” tool. (Contrast this with “out-of sample prediction”
where we use a new dataset to see how well our model predicts the
response variable of that <em>new</em> dataset.) All that means is; AIC
is a tool that evaluates the predictive ability of a model, in
predicting the data that you used to fit the model. With this view of
AIC, a parsimonious model simply represents a model that has “good”
predictive ability. Importantly, however, such models are not intended
to offer insights into causation. Indeed, for causal inference, AIC can
be quite harmful.</p>
<p>For example, consider the following scenario. We are interested in
the association between ice cream sales and shark attacks. There is no
direct causal relationship between these two variables. Instead, it is
the number of beach visitors that determines <em>both</em> ice cream
sales and shark attacks.</p>
<p>Regardless of causal mechanisms, finding a set of parameter values
that captures the association between ice cream sales and shark attacks
is trivial for <code>glm()</code>. This is what <code>glm()</code> is
designed to do after all - estimate associations. If we were to use AIC
on this hypothetical model it would strongly support including ice cream
sales in the model, because knowing how many ice creams have been sold
is pretty much telling us how many people were at the beach.</p>
<p>Test it out if your skeptical:</p>
<pre><code>set.seed(123) # set seed so results are consistent
N &lt;- 200 # 200 beaches
visitors &lt;- rpois(N, lambda = 10) # generate 200 visitor counts
# Note that icecream does not appear when simulating shark, just visitors
shark &lt;- rbinom(N, size = 1, prob = plogis(-4 + 0.2 * visitors)) # shark attack
# Note that shark does not appear when simulating icecream, just visitors
icecream &lt;- rpois(N, lambda = exp(-5 + 0.5 * visitors)) # number of ice creams
dat &lt;- data.frame(visitors, shark, icecream) # combine into dataset
mod1 &lt;- glm(shark ~ icecream, family = binomial, data = dat) # run bernoulli glm
drop1(mod1) # use AIC to do variable selection
# AIC of full model: 167.29
# AIC of model without icecream: 171.08</code></pre>
<p>The upside of this is that including <code>icecream</code> is very
useful if we want to make predictions of shark attacks. For example, if
there are two beaches, the first with very few ice cream sales, and the
second with lots. Which beach is more at risk of shark attacks? Clearly
we can predict the second beach is at higher risk, we just don’t know
<em>why</em> (based on the model).</p>
<p>With that in mind, my view is that AIC is most useful, and least
risky, when used for prediction modelling. There are alternatives to
AIC, but AIC is still useful never-the-less. Let’s use AIC and variable
selection now in order to determine which covariates give us predictive
power, and which we can simply ignore when trying to make accurate
predictions.</p>
<p>Starting off with the full model and using <code>drop1()</code>,
which covariates can be removed without reducing our predictive
power?</p>
<p>Using <code>drop1()</code> to identify which covariates can be
removed, refit that model.</p>

<h3>7. Check your assumption(s).</h3>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>As always, we want to check how well we’re meeting the assumptions
(which we can test).</p>
<p>Start off by using the methods that have served us well for the <span
class="math inline">\(Poisson\)</span> adn <span
class="math inline">\(Binomial\)</span> GLMs,
(e.g. <code>plot(mod2)</code> and <code>summary()</code>). Are these
plots useful? Can we calculate dispersion for a <span
class="math inline">\(Bernoulli\)</span> GLM?</p>
<p><img src="GLM_3_Bernoulli_exercise_files/figure-html/Q7-1.png" width="672" /></p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>The diagnostics tests we’ve used up to this point have largely failed
us for Bernoulli GLMs. As such we need to think of alternative ways to
try and check our assumptions. In this instance, we can use the method
we discussed in the lecture where we extract the Pearson residuals from
the model, and plot these against our explanatory covariates.</p>
<p>Extracting residuals is a pretty easy process. To do so, we use the
code:</p>
<pre><code>netflix$resid &lt;- resid(mod2, type = &quot;pearson&quot;)</code></pre>
<p>With the above code, we’re simply adding a new column to our original
dataset that contains the Pearson residual error for each observation
(<span class="math inline">\(i\)</span>) based on the model that you fit
(here, called <code>mod2</code>). Now we need to load a package and use
the appropriate function to make plotting residuals and diagnosing a bit
easier: <code>binnedplot</code> from the <code>arm</code> package.</p>
<p>Using these plots, identify any covariates you think we should be
concerned about, and why.</p>
<p>Hints: * For categorical variables, we can force these to be numeric,
and therefore use <code>binnedplot()</code> by doing
<code>binnedplot(y = dat$resid, x = as.numeric(dat$category), nclass = 3, xlab = "My categorical variable")</code></p>

<h3>9. Create figures to show predicted relationships.</h3>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>We’re now in a position to show our predicted relationships. To do
so, we’re going to recycle the method we used in the <span
class="math inline">\(Binomial\)</span> GLM exercise.</p>
<p>For these predictions, Netflix are especially interested in
identifying which type of user to give targeted adverts to on
<strong>Sunday afternoons</strong>, such that they are more likely to
watch LoTR. For us, this means we want to make our predictions specific
to Sunday afternoons.</p>
<p>So you don’t have to flip back to the <span
class="math inline">\(Binomial\)</span> GLM exercise, here’s the code we
used to make our predictions in yesterdays exercise.</p>
<pre><code># Create a fake dataset to feed into our model equation
synth_data &lt;- expand.grid(
  n_staff = median(netflix$n_staff), 
  policy = &quot;Implemented&quot;,        
  capacity = seq(
    from = min(netflix$capacity), 
    to = max(netflix$capacity),   
    length.out = 20))   
synth_data$pred &lt;- predict(mod1, newdata = synth_data, se.fit = TRUE)
synth_data$pred &lt;- plogis(pred$fit)
synth_data$low &lt;- plogis(pred$fit - pred$se.fit * 1.96)
synth_data$upp &lt;- plogis(pred$fit + pred$se.fit * 1.96)</code></pre>
<p>Adapt this code for our current model (i.e. add in the relevant
covariates to <code>expand.grid()</code>) to show the relationships for
<code>age</code>, <code>genre_likes</code>, <code>actor_likes</code>,
<code>similar_user_ratings</code>, <code>mean_time_genre</code>,
<code>user_device</code> and <code>family members</code></p>

<h3>11. (Optional) Exploring model diagnostics</h3>
<p>As in previous exercises, below I include code to simulate a <span

the impact of sample size, model misspecification, and effect size, on
model diagnostic plots. The <em>Data Generating Process</em> (DGP) for
the dataset is:</p>

\times x_{1, i} \times x_{2,i}\)</span></p>

(e.g. <code>beta_0 &lt;- 10</code>) or the formula of the
